# Endometriosis
Endometriosis Analysis

In this mini project, we are trying to diagnose endometriosis chronic disease. 
The list of symtoms shows the most relevant symtoms to the endometriosis. 

- In order to predict the disease , we only keep the most correlated features. 

- ML models whcih has been used:
'LinearSVM','rbfSVM','KNearestNeighbors','RandomForestClassifier','DecisionTree','GradientBoostingClassifier','GaussianNB'
- Feature importance shows:
  - significant correlation between chronic pelvic pain and Endometriosis

  - sexual pain (deep dyspareunia) was found to be associated with musculoskeletal pain contributors (abdominal wall pain and pelvic floor tenderness)

- Hierarchical Clustering also applied and showed,
  - Infertility is correlated to Ovarian Cysts, Heavy bleeding, pelvic pain, Dyspareunia and Endometriosis.
